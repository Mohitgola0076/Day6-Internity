            # Introduction To NumPy:

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

            # Why Use NumPy Arrays :
            
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

            # Disadvantages of NumPy :
            
Using “nan” in Numpy:-- “Nan” stands for “not a number”. It was designed to address the problem of missing values. NumPy itself supports “nan” but lack of cross-platform support within Python makes it difficult for the user.
Require a contiguous allocation of memory:-- Insertion and deletion operations become costly as data is stored in contiguous memory locations as shifting it requires shifting.

            # Installation Required : 
            
Command required in terminal to install it :--    pip install numpy
